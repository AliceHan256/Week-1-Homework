## Landscape:

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?

In 2009, Shopify created an API platform and app store to sell product online.

In 2010, while smartphones were bloating globally, Shopify lauched a "Build a Business" competition which generated over $3 million in revenue. 

In 2011, Shopify added Shopify Experts for less experienced sellers to seek knowledge of Shopify from this directory.

In 2013, Shopify redesigned its platform by adding features such as refund management, better search functionality, easier-to-use admin features, and a live theme editor, all of which make the platform easier for merchants to use. In addition, Shopify released POS, which makes merchants to sell their inventory both in-store and online where data can be synched easily.

In 2015, Shopify introduced the Buy Buttons and Multichannel Shopify to its platform for merchants to use the innovated dashboard to manage their sales across multichannels, including the e-commerce storefront, POS, and buy buttons which allow merchants to embed it on any website.

In 2016, Shopify integrated with Facebook Messenger, allowing merchants to have communications with their customers directly. 

In 2017, Shopify introduced QR codes which makes shoppers to use their phone camera to scan the QR code on a physical item and get access to the item from the merchant's online store.

Doing this way, Shopify expanded from an initial tool to a platform then to a ecosystem, eventually growing to a $10 billion commercial giat. 

Major companies in this domain include Magento, PrestaShop, OpenCart, BigCommerce, WooCommerce, ECShop (China), Color Me Shop (Japan), Tienda Nube (Argentina), and so on.

## Results

By the 1st of Sep 2020, there have been 1,498,823 live websites around the world, and there are 3.6% of the Top 1m websites using Shopify. BuiltWith's data confirms the worldwide sales realized through Shopify is $135B. Shopify is popular in all English-speaking markets.

Core metrics could measure a company's success from aspects of popularity, number of market shares, user-frendly, simple, customer focus, multilingual interface, and the ability to adapt to market changes.

## Recommendations

Currently, most of POS focused on selling products cannot do things for accommodation reservation. It will be a breakout if this function can be added.

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
By adding this function, many companies whose business cover both accommodation and restaurant don't have to subscribe separate softwares which can cut huge costs, including software and labour costs.
