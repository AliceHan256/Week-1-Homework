# Week-1-Homework

## Overview and Origin

Name of company: Shopify Inc.

The company was founded in 2006.

The company was founded by Tobias Lütke, Daniel Weinand, and Scott Lake.

Lütke desatisfied the existing e-commerce products and built his own online store, Snowdevil, by using the open source web application framework Ruby on Rails and lunched it two months later. The Snowdevil founders launched Shopify in 2006.

Shopify made $100 million in 2009 by selling their shopping cart system. Its Series A round raised $7 million from Bessemer Venture Partners, FirstMark Capital and Felicis Ventures in the late of 2010. Later, its Series B round raised $15 million from Bessemer Venture Partners, FirstMark Capital, Felicis Ventures, and Georgian Partners in 2011.
