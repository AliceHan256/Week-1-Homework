# Week-1-Homework

## Overview and Origin

Name of company: Shopify Inc.

The company was founded in 2006.

The company was founded by Tobias Lütke, Daniel Weinand, and Scott Lake.

Lütke desatisfied the existing e-commerce products and built his own online store, Snowdevil, by using the open source web application framework Ruby on Rails and lunched it two months later. The Snowdevil founders launched Shopify in 2006.

Shopify made $100 million in 2009 by selling their shopping cart system. Its Series A round raised $7 million from Bessemer Venture Partners, FirstMark Capital and Felicis Ventures in the late of 2010. Later, its Series B round raised $15 million from Bessemer Venture Partners, FirstMark Capital, Felicis Ventures, and Georgian Partners in 2011.

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?

In 2009, Shopify created an API platform and app store to sell product online.

In 2010, while smartphones were bloating globally, Shopify lauched a "Build a Business" competition which generated over $3 million in revenue. 

In 2011, Shopify added Shopify Experts for less experienced sellers to seek knowledge of Shopify from this directory.

In 2013, Shopify redesigned its platform by adding features such as refund management, better search functionality, easier-to-use admin features, and a live theme editor, all of which make the platform easier for merchants to use. In addition, Shopify released POS, which makes merchants to sell their inventory both in-store and online where data can be synched easily.

In 2015, Shopify introduced the Buy Buttons and Multichannel Shopify to its platform for merchants to use the innovated dashboard to manage their sales across multichannels, including the e-commerce storefront, POS, and buy buttons which allow merchants to embed it on any website.

In 2016, Shopify integrated with Facebook Messenger, allowing merchants to have communications with their customers directly. 

In 2017, Shopify introduced QR codes which makes shoppers to use their phone camera to scan the QR code on a physical item and get access to the item from the merchant's online store.

Doing this way, Shopify expanded from an initial tool to a platform then to a ecosystem, eventually growing to a $10 billion commercial giat.
